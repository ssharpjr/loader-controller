v1.0:
  * Initial release.  First deployed version.
v1.1
  * Added pallet sensor feature.  This monitors an infrared sensor to detect the presence of a pallet.
    If the pallet is missing, the loader will not function.
  * Added the Workorder monitor feature.  This monitors the currently running workorder and restarts the program if it changes.
  * Renamed loader_controller.py to make it easier to import.
